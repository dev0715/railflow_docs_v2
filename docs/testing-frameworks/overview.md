# Overview

### What is a test framework?
>In most programming languages unit and integration tests are written in some test framework. This test framework provides users the full power of the underlying technology stack along with a variety of hooks for writing powerful tests. 

Here are some of the more popular test frameworks 
- JAVA: TestNG, and JUnit
- Python: Unit Test (built-it), Pytest, Nose
- JavaScript: JEST, Mocha, Jasmine
- .NET: NUnit, X-Unit, MSTest

### Why use Railflow within some Test Framework?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Out of the box, Railflow is able to process all major test reports from all major test frameworks. For most of our users, simply processing and uploading these test reports to TestRail using Railflow's CI plugins or the CLI will be sufficient. 

>Some users have complex needs such as having the ability to map coded tests to existing tests, plans, suites, runs, or milestones in TestRail. For such users, Railflow provides test framework specific extensions so that you can do these advanced configurations and workflows.


### What test frameworks does Railflow integrate with?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Railflow provides deep framework level extensions for JAVA's TestNG and JUnit, Python's Pytest, JavaScript's Mocha, and .NET's Nunit and MSTest framework. We are always working on adding support for new frameworks.
